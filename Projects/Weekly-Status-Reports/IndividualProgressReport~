Next Week's goals

week1:
     This week I dont know about the group members, we are getting the introductory lectures of software engineering like what is the software engineering and what it is not. After some days we made a group for project.

week2: 
      In the week2 I think off many new ideas, I discussed with my group members and we made a list of all the existing software applications and we try to come up with our own application which may be better version of already existing applications or completely new one. Some of the ideas which we got are 
1.platform for selling old books in the college
2.Platform for connecting barbers and those who want cutting. 
    like this we think off many possible apps but finally i suggested my group to select the hair cutting app because this is looking like some fresh idea.
We prepared to build it so i started searching for correct technologies for building it, those are  django,nodejs,JS.

week3: 
       In this week i got to know by the professor that our app is not so complex so we triggred to another application.
The another idea which we got was building a game  factory. game factory is having a collections of games created by us. a normal 2d games.
Currently i am documenting every thing which iam doing and which iam thinking.
