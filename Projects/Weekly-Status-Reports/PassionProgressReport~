Week1:
   
    This week we have attended the software engineering classes which  are very interesting. We have to do some 
    projects to complete this course which are individual and passion project. So i started thinking for passion 
    projects .
    When it comes to passion I am passionate  about  being fit so I want to make an  app  which will help 
           people to be fit.
        
Week2:
     I am passionate about being fit but this is not a complex app . If that is the case then I want to build 
     an app for game. I also started started searching for frame works for making an game. Which is unity 3d.

Week3:
      In this week i have decided to do some game for that i have searched for technologies which is Unity. 
      With the help of this game engine i can create a 3d game. The game is that a person will be in the 
      forest along with a gun, he need to hunt the animals which are running infront of him. He will get a 
      points for each shot, if he hit the target correctly.
Next Week's goals:Learning Unity frame work.
